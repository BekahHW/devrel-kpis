I don't try to read it all as soon as it hits my inbox.\n\nThis has been a primary mission for our new email product hey.com ‚Äì get you off the inbox-zero treadmill, and back to loving email, because you're reading the important stuff urgently, and the leisurely stuff when you have time.\n\nNo stress, no shame.",
